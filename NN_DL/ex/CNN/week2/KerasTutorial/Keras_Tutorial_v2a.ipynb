    "Welcome to the first assignment of week 2. In this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. \n",
    "2. See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are we using Keras? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. \n",
    "* Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. \n",
    "* Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. \n",
    "* However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you would still implement in TensorFlow rather than in Keras. \n",
    "* That being said, Keras will work fine for many common models. "

    "```python\n",
    "X = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), strides = (1, 1), name = 'conv0')(X)\n",
    "X = BatchNormalization(axis = 3, name = 'bn0')(X)\n",
    "X = Activation('relu')(X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "until your height and width dimensions are quite low and your number of channels quite large (≈32 for example).  \n",
    "You can then flatten the volume and use a fully-connected layer.\n",
    "- Use MAXPOOL after such blocks.  It will help you lower the dimension in height and width.\n",
    "- Change your optimizer. We find 'adam' works well. \n",
    "- If you get memory issues, lower your batch_size (e.g. 12 )\n",
    "- Run more epochs until you see the train accuracy no longer improves. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you perform hyperparameter tuning on your model, the test set actually becomes a dev set, and your model might end up overfitting to the test (dev) set. Normally, you'll want separate dev and test sets.  The dev set is used for parameter tuning, and the test set is used once to estimate the model's performance in production."
